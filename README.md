# Proper Coding Protocols for Vue
1. Created Components for easy maintain
2. Added env file for global variables
3. Added comments for slightly complex codes
4. No inline styles added
5. Didnt use $parent for parent component variables to create a loosely coupled system. Used v-model and prop instead

Note: Could've used vuex and typescript but its only a small project so i didn't

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
